## About the Atelier

Ateljé Vagabond is a small creative studio based in Sweden, working at the intersection of  
**handcrafted metalwork, electro-etching, digital design, embedded hardware, and modern software.**

**Based in Landskrona, in the heart of Skåne.**

We believe craft should never stand still.  
A project may begin as a sketch, travel through code, touch copper or steel, and return as a finished object or a digital tool.  
Art and engineering meet here, without borders.

## Why Vagabond

Because craft should never stand still.  
We work in the space between ancient metalwork, digital design, and modern electronics, letting each discipline push the others forward.

A vagabond is not rootless.  
A vagabond explores, refusing to settle into one craft, one tradition, one identity.

**So do we.**

Every project is a crossing, a dialogue between worlds that were never meant to touch but become something new together.  
We wander through techniques, borrowing from chemistry, engraving, coding, and design.

The work becomes a journey, from pixel to metal, from idea to object, from past to future.

We believe the objects you carry, touch, or use should hold weight, memory, and story.

**That is why we create.**

## What We Build

### • Creative Electronics (Custom-Made)
Embedded systems and functional art built specifically for individuals and companies.  
Custom devices, lighting, controllers, and hybrid tools that blend engineering with design.

### • AI-Assisted Tools & Workflows
Products and processes shaped through a balance of intuition and machine intelligence.  
Systems where creativity, logic, and AI enhance each other.

### • Software & Web Technology
Cloudflare Workers, edge APIs, minimal backends, image pipelines, and integration tools for fast and elegant web experiences.

### • Cloud Services, Infrastructure & DevOps
Modern cloud architecture designed with efficiency and clarity.  
We build serverless APIs, edge-focused systems, and container workflows that are secure, observable, and easy to maintain.  
CI/CD pipelines, IaC, automation, and reliability engineering are treated as part of the craft itself.

### • Hardware & Embedded Experiments
ESP32-based systems, PCB design, sensors, power electronics, and physical-digital interactions.

### • Metalwork & Electro-Etching
Traditional craftsmanship pushed forward by digital precision, chemistry, and handmade detailing.

# Our “STANCE” Manifesto

- **S — Sustainability**  
  What we build must matter and respect the world it enters.  
  We evaluate impact, energy efficiency, repairability, and longevity.

- **T — Thoughtfulness**  
  We do not create because we can.  
  We build with intention, restraint, and clarity of purpose.

- **A — Augmentation**  
  AI and modern tools expand our capacity to think, learn, and create.  
  Technology is a multiplier, not a replacement for human judgment.

- **N — Necessity**  
  A product must serve a real need, without excess or spectacle.  
  Resource use must always be justified.

- **C — Craft**  
  Quality is the baseline.  
  Security, durability, engineering clarity, and honest craftsmanship guide everything we build.

- **E — Ethics**  
  We share openly when it benefits the community,  
  and we protect what must remain private.  
  Responsibility defines our boundaries.
